Meaningfulness

Your past choices do not define you.
- I am willing to bet that you have things in your house that you bought sometime in the past and which no longer affects your life whatsoever...but you haven't let go of it.
- vcr's and vcr players





Stoicism and minimalism

The only 2 reasons to practice self-growth (?)
1. to make it easier to live your life and to do the things you both need and want to do
2. to discover and understand your truths

bad reasons:
* because this one thing seems like a cool addition to make you more well-rounded
* because other people have it or it's the new hot thing -- fear of missing out
* because you feel like you have to always be improving in order to be happy -- hedonism treadmill
* to feel 'productive' -- it might actually be detracting from important things in your life like examining the state of your life and identifying areas of needed changes
* because you think it will make you happy

You can't have it all (and you may have much less than what you may, if you don't let go of everything that's not the most important)
bcause that's not posisible. so choose what you actually want and you have a better chance of achieving it






The art of discarding, nagisa tatsumi
-  "it's very simple: keep things you use, and discard things you don't."
- kind, thoughtful, common sense tone






care about the cents, and the dollars will take care of themselves.
- when you take the time to make thoughtful decicions about the small things that make up the big one, the big one is solved. when you curate your wardrobe item by item, thinking abotu the items rathr than the wardrobe, your wardrobe takes care of itself.

new shampoo came in and i finally set aside the old bottle. it was still 3/4 full, testament to my reluctance to use it. but i didnt trow i out, until the 'do't keep it "for now"' section. i didnt finish the section, i just got ip and threw it out. there was a moment of sadness and wastefulness. and then, there was a glow of clarity and peacefullness, for just a quiet moment before settling, of a sense of things being in their places. Thank you to Tatsumi for that relief.




it is a mistake to belive that not throwing something away is the same as taking care of it -- and if you want a clear, clean, decluttered, ordered, and light life, you must care for every item in your possession.


coming to grips with your things alters your approach with new things coming in.

when I cleared away, i suddenly discovered abundance.
- when your needs are not the size of your intake, the difference feels like true wealth. it's the difference between the food you've eaten and the food you leave on the plate because you've had enough. it's the difference between the money you spent on groceries, knowing you won't be needing anything else until your next paycheck, and the rest of this week's paycheck left in the bank. when I sold my library of books, I felt abundance in time and money, knowing i could read whatever I wanted by going to the library or buying a cheap e-book, while having so much more clean space, clarity, and distance from the part of me that demanded i read more than i feel like inorder to support an ego identity of 'avid reader'.
- having less stuff allmost magicallly turns into fewer needs andvwants, and your real needs becoome both aparent and manageable beaise theyre immediately less than what you dealt with before.






the places you use the most should be the ones you keep cleanest.
- inbox zero
- clean kitchen counters and stovetop
- desk space
