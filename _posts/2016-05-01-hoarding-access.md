When I was a kid, I didn't have access to much of anything. Didn't have access to food, money, good clothes, books. [I did have enough toys though! I wanted more, like a normal kid, but it was within healthy parameters of want.] Generally to things that brought joy or pleasure.

I feel that I've kept that sense of lack of access for a long time. Access to food was easiest to dismantle, with my lack of stopping myself from purchasing delicious things every single time I go shopping, for many years.

Money got easier too once I went to college and then grad school where I ran all my own finances and had a steady sum coming in from loans. I began to understand that money comes with work and over time. Good clothes got easier then too, it only took a couple experiences to accept that I had access to whatever I wanted, my wants weren't particularly great.

But books, that's an interesting conundrum. On one hand, access to information is incredibly important to me because I can't keep things in my head easily. As for fantasy, novels, scifi, etc--even some from the first category--they are experiences in physical form. How can I say no to them? How do I discard them?

I've let go of books that don't mean much to me, some that were lost, some that I knew I wouldn't really want to read often (like the LoTR hardcovers I left at Inna's when I left for the last time). But it's been pretty hard to let go of books. Even after I downloaded my 10K+ library, I still felt extremely vulnerable where my books were concerned, afraid to lose them...to lose access to books. Afraid in some way that if I lost access tot hose books I experienced in my past, I would somehow cut off the book experiences I could have in the future. That I couldn't get those books again if I needed to, when I wanted them. I know if I experienced a delay in getting them, it would painfully trigger my sense of locked-in-ness, no-access-ness from before.

I know what I want to get to--I want to be ok with not owning...but I want to feel like I have limitless access.

Access to me means:
- being able to get an item whenever I want
- being able to control the item, do whatever I want to it
- being able to control it staying in a certain condition

So in a way, access to me actually means being able to control the book's life-path, its trajectory over time.

Stepping away from wanting that kind of access would change access to:

- finding a way to be in touch with an item when I want or need it, or if it happens into my world on its own
- spending time with it for a time within its life-path
- not being in control of it, but being responsible for its well-being while it is in my care
- saying goodbye without a sense of loss, implicitly understanding that beginnings and endings are part of the experience.

What the two states of access are trying to accomplish:
#1 is trying to maximize the good feelings the book gives me to bend its fate to my life-path so I can feel the good feelings anytime I want. It is trying to heighten and keep joy.
#2 is trying to maximize the good feelings the book gives me in the moment by being unattached and staying connected to the reality of not being in control--passing by beauty, like a landscape or a painting in a museum. It is trying to stay in touch with implicit joy.

I remember from working with Ze'ev that he would deal with this via parts integration; elicit both parts, find where they both were trying to do the same thing, then integrate them. But I don't want to integrate. I think wholeness for me is not fighting my change, but transforming and spinning without impediment. I think integration can have the experience of unifying one's inner energy and vitality by simplifying to meaninglessness one's inner decisions and determinations.

So as much as I would like to liberate my inner energy and vitality, I will do so in a different way: by letting go of my past self and past methods of feeling joy. Those self-decisions made then will liquidate into self-energy again. And I--I will be clean, conscious, and deliberate.
