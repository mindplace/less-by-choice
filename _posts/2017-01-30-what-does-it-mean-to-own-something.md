But that's no longer in line with how I see my stuff. Instead, I had to redefine my relationship with books, and in fact with all of my things:

- I have to trust my future self to be able to get an item when I want or need it
- I must appreciate the item if I choose to own it
- I must let go of it if I don't need, want, or appreciate it
- I know that though I might own something, I can never truly control it
- I must live up to being responsible for an item while it is in my care
- I know that everything we own is a temporary relationship, and will at some point end
- I can goodbye without a sense of loss, understanding that beginnings and endings are part of the experience.
