- before you start, think about what the end result should look like, what would be the best outcome for you, so you know what you're working towards and what done looks like

- choose what to keep, not what to throw out

- take everything of a single category out of their usual spots in order to sort through them; don't just browse your shelves or storage looking for things to let go of.

- the way you decide on any one thing showcases your values, so use the right criteria, whether that's determining if that item makes you happy, whether you feel only positive things when you actually touch it, whether you actually get value from it in everyday life, or whatever.

- if you live with others, don't touch any of their things or pressure them to join your clearing-out process

- don't offer your unwanted items to people around you; offer them on freecycle, give them to charity, or sell them to or through institutions, but don't burden people around you.

- everything you own is a relationship you're in. Is it a good relationship? Or do you or it feel neglected and want out?
