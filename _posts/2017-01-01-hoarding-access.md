takeaway: ["What are the things you are afraid to let go of because you are afraid of losing access?"]
---

When I was a kid, I didn't have access to much of anything. I often didn't have access to food, money, clothes that fit, books, and generally to things that brought joy or pleasure. My family had immigrated from Soviet Russia in 1990, and we lived under tight conditions throughout my childhood.

I feel that I've kept that sense of lack of access for a long time. Today I have a good income and can afford to choose more widely, but the feeling and fear of scarcity remains.

Money and food access became easier once I entered college and then grad school, where I controlled my own finances and had a steady influx of money coming in from scholarships, grants, student loans, and jobs. I strongly remember the feeling of going to buy groceries and being able to say yes to things I had craved for a long time.

I also began to trust that money comes with work and over time. It seems like a funny thing to say, but it feels really good to trust that if I work, I'll be paid. Good clothes got easier then too, it only took a couple experiences to accept that I had access to whatever I wanted, and my wants in that respect turned out to not be particularly great.

But books, that was an interesting conundrum. On one hand, access to information is incredibly important to me. Beyond that, though, books are really experiences in physical form. How can I say no to them? How do I discard them?

<h2 class="header small-header">having access to books</h2>

Over the years, due to travels and moves, I've let go of books that didn't mean much to me, some that were lost, some that I knew I wouldn't really want to read often. But it's been pretty hard to let go of books deliberately when I decided to minimize. There was a time a few years ago when I had thousands of e-books on my computer, but I still felt extremely vulnerable where my books were concerned, afraid to lose them, to lose access to books. It wasn't about how many I had. It was about filling a hole that would never be filled.  

When I decided to downsize, I knew what I wanted to get to: I want to be ok with not owning. But I want to feel like I had access even if the books I wanted in the moment weren't immediately available. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get those books again if I needed to, when I wanted them.

<h2 class="header small-header">Redefining access</h2>

Access to me meant being able to get an item whenever I want, and to hold on to it for however long I want. As a minimalist, that definition doesn't sit well with me anymore.

There was something I had to learn and make that knowing a part of me, before I could let go of my books--and in fact my things in general. That was that **I can only trust my future self to get what I need, when I need it.**

I can only do what I can with what I have, today. I can't foresee the future and I shouldn't attempt to preempt my needs, my perceptions of what I will want or need have demonstrably not been true. Certainly I had been wrong to think I would definitely read any of the dozens of books that were left unread, years after the purchase date. And it was exhausting to cart them from country to country and try to find storage when I couldn't.

I can only do what I can with what I have today, but I can do a lot. I must trust that my future self will only be more capable and more resourceful.

My job is not to give the me of tomorrow everything she might need. My job is to take away from tomorrow's plate everything unnecessary, so that every day I wake up to an easier life where I have the clarity, time, space, and money to make better choices.
