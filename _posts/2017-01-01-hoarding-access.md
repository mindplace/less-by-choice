takeaway: ["What are the things you are afraid to let go of because you are afraid of losing access?"]
---

When I was a kid, I didn't have access to much. I often didn't have access to food, money, clothes that fit, books. My family had emigrated from Soviet Russia in 1990, and we lived under tight conditions throughout my childhood.

I feel that that sense of lack of access stayed with me, even as my circumstances changed. I have a good income now and can afford to choose more widely, but the feeling and fear of scarcity remains.

Money and food access initially became easier when I entered college and then grad school, where I controlled my own finances and had a steady influx of money coming in from scholarships, grants, student loans, and jobs. I strongly remember the feeling of going to buy groceries and being able to say yes to things I had craved for a long time.

I also began to trust that money comes with work and over time. It seems like a funny thing to say, but it feels good to trust that if I work, I'll be paid. Good clothes got easier then too, it only took a couple experiences to accept that I had access to whatever I wanted, and my wants in that respect turned out to not be particularly great.

But books, that was a very different question. On one hand, access to information is very important to me. But books aren't necessarily how I meet that need. When I need to know something, I'll look it up online. Or if it's an extensive topic, I often find an appropriate text at my library.

Instead, I've had to acknowledge that books are really experiences in physical form. The ones I held on to are those that made me feel a certain way, go to some mental place that I wanted to be able to go to on a whim. How can I say no to that? How can I discard books, knowing this?

<h2 class="header small-header">having access to books</h2>

Over the years, due to travels and moves, I've let go of some books that didn't mean much to me. Some got lost, some were those I knew I didn't want to reread, some were lent out and never gotten back.

But it's been hard to let go of books deliberately when I decided to minimize. There was a time a few years ago when I had thousands of e-books on my computer, but I still felt extremely vulnerable where my books were concerned, afraid to lose them, to lose the experiences they represented to me. It wasn't about how many I had. It was about filling a hole that could never be filled. I realized that when my mind turned to reading, I often spent more time thinking about the books I potentially wanted to read, and browsing Amazon and Goodreads, instead of actually reading.

When I decided to downsize, I knew what I wanted to get to: I want to be ok with not owning. But I want to feel like I had access even if the books I wanted in the moment weren't immediately available. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get those books again if I needed to, when I wanted them.

<h2 class="header small-header">Redefining access</h2>

Access to me meant being able to get an item whenever I want, and to hold on to it for however long I want. As a minimalist, that definition doesn't sit well with me anymore.

There was something I had to learn and make that knowing a part of me, before I could let go of my books...and in fact my things in general. That was that I can only trust my future self to get what I need, when I need it.

I can only do what I can with what I have, today. I can't foresee the future and I shouldn't attempt to preempt my needs, because my perceptions of what I will want or need have demonstrably not been true. Certainly I had been wrong to think I would definitely read any of the dozens of books that were left unread, years after the purchase date. And it was exhausting to cart them from country to country and try to find storage when I couldn't.

<h2 class="header small-header">after the purge</h2>

As of today, I own 13 physical books. 3 are programming-related books for my career. 2 are cookbooks I often reference. 2 are children's books I love. 1 is on communication. 1 is Marie Kondo's <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up?ac=1&from_search=true">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>. 3 are on various spirituality topics. And the last one is my favorite fantasy/speculative fiction book, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell">Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</a>.

I also have about 300 digital books, down from 10k+ that I used to have.

These collections are temporary. At some point I'll have finished reading the programming books, I'll be tired of the cookbooks, or I'll discover that I no longer want or need the others, and let them go.

I have had to come believe, not just know, that I can only do what I can with what I have today. But, I can do a lot, more than past me was able to. I must trust that my future self will only be more capable and more resourceful.

My job is not to give the me of tomorrow everything she might need. My job is to take away from tomorrow's plate everything unnecessary, so that every day I wake up to an easier life where I have the clarity, time, space, and money to make better choices.
