Marie Kondo said to decide what to keep based on what sparks joy. This was a radical concept for me, and really served to flip my mindset. I stopped thinking about what to throw out, and started to think about what I will keep. I started to let go of things in order to feel the happiness that was already there.

But after clearing out my things in this way, I've realized that I'm not finished yet. I've lived my whole life allowing things to stick to me, and so the things that I love came into my life by accident. So I still have things I will probably end up letting go of because I didn't consider whether they would fit into my attempt to curate a deliberate life.

My next purge will be the result of reviewing my things for functionality. I must keep things that work together and unify my pursuits rather than letting myself own things that fracture my attention.

But if I knew, before konmari-ing my stuff, that that would only be the first step, I wouldn't have understood. I would have felt troubled that I wouldn't be 'finished' at the end of it. I would have lost faith in trying it her way. Worst of all, I would have gone more slowly, and that would mean I might never have really managed to edit my ideas about who I am, and transition into minimalism.

Yes, downsizing is a process. But if you use this to give yourself permission to clear out only a little every day, you're not altering what really matters: your identity as someone who owns too much of the unnecessary. And your habits won't change: you'll continue to bring things into your life using the same reasoning as what led you to need to clear out in the first place.

<h2 class="header small-header">Don't let go of your things, let go of outdated identities.</h2>

A minimalist mindset and an identity as a person living lightly: without these, you'll tidy and downsize and clear our every day and you will never be done. But try placing someone who is already a minimalist into a maximalist environment and see how fast they whittle it down.

It's not just that they wouldn't have emotional attachment to this stuff. It's that they already identify as people who don't own much. They will take action to correct their environment to return themselves to their level of comfort and tolerance.

Until you stop identifying add someone who owns an overabundance of things, you will either never really clear out what's unnecessary, or find yourself feeling quietly unhappy with this lifestyle change.

While you identify as a knitter, not having knitting needles or yarn will feel like you're missing something.

While you identify as a reader, you'll keep books you haven't read, don't actually care for now or anymore, or which no longer serve you, in order to prove to yourself and others that you read.

While you identify as a cook, getting rid of kitchen machines (even those you only used once or twice) will feel like sacrifice.

The person you tell yourself you are is always an artificial story, out of date as soon as you  think of it. Its job is to help you make sense of your present in terms of your history, and it demands that you spend time and attention reinforcing it.

I want freedom from those kinds of self-imposed boundaries, even if it means I won't really know how I identify from day to day. I want a blank slate, and the potential to make or do anything I choose.

I don't want to be a knitter and keep yarn because years ago I knitted everyone scarves for holiday gifts and people loved them. I don't want to call myself a reader if I spend more time talking about books than reading them. I don't want to be a cook if it means attachment to stuff that my life doesn't actually have space or time for.

But that doesn't mean I don't or won't choose to knit or read or cook. It just means I am free to acknowledge what I actually want today. And today I want freedom, clarity, and raw potential. So the yarn, the library, and the food processor get donated. :)
