What feels like home? What do roots feel like?
Home feels like:

- vine plants. Healthy plants in the windows, not too many, not overcrowded.
- sunlight. joyful sunlight. quiet sunlight leaking through every window, landing gently upon plants and objects.
- buddhas, wooden statues, spiritual items.
- teacups. mismatching tea sets and dishes and everything comfortably unpretentious.
- neat, clean lines. no clutter.
- everything in its place. visually not too many small things in one spot together.
- familiar books, neatly on a shelf.
- my most used items close at hand: teacup, kindle, planner, ipad, current book.

- making a meal for someone loved. a small meal, mostly vegetable ingredients, lots of garlic. Small plates, small table, informality in every way.

- comfortable couch afternoon or evening. sitting quietly, reading, enjoying the quiet atmosphere.

Home is for:
relaxing
being
waiting
stalling

I guess I'm not comfortable with the idea of home being a workspace too.
I would like to reunderstand it...
Home: a place to do things that make me happy.
Roots:
feel like putting myself into the place I am in
holding on to it
accepting it
deciding to align myself with it
no, deciding to affiliate myself with it.

It's that quality of holding on that is problematic for me. I don't want to hold on, I want to be held. I want to melt and accept.
Actively choosing to hold on, to fix it to myself--not ideal.
Ok. So it's  not ideal.
When have things ever been the ideal?
They have always been not quite.
But i haven't committed to them as they were. The way they were was ultimately static and it will always be that way for things. It is illusory to think of things as changing. They will just be themselves, then stay that way forever within that moment in time. All of the potential goodness I preserved by not committing...was my noncommittal.

That's not goodness, that's the opposite of goodness. Not accepting, rejoicing in, cleaving to reality, to today's moment, is itself a form of attachment--attachment to the ideal, to the abstract, which itself should be more malleable, not less, to form to functional reality as it is.

I want to accept where I am
I want to allow all the energy in me to be freely flowing by not fighting this boundary between accepted-self and unaccepted-outside
I want to fundamentally acknowledge goodness on a subliminal level by accepting it and taking it in
I want to just be aligned with reality...
