takeaway: ["Why is it worth it for you to break up with your clutter?"]
---

Owning my own home - and having it be built/organized/decorated to my desired standards, where there isn't any major thing that has been left untouched because it's 'too expensive to upgrade'
Having the electronics I want which work in a top-notch fashion (basically CHECK to that!)
Owning my own car (with same caveats as electronics and own home)
Having no debt; $30k or more in the bank; and an investment portfolio which allows a safe 4% yearly withdrawal rate of 30k - meaning I wouldn't have to rely on work income to sustain my financial needs
-----------
Having several close relationships which offer support, affection, and companionship
Having entrance to various social groups
-----------
Having a bigger-than-myself project or work that I love and believe in, which demands my dedication, mental faculty, and prioritization.
