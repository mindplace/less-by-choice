Tangibles:
- Food, especially special things like sweets, coffee, special yoghurts, prepared foods.
- Groceries in general: I overbuy and therefore overspend, have too much to haul home, and throw out a large part of it when it goes bad from not being wanted or used fast enough.
- Kitchen cooking items, or things like cups, plates, etc.
- Candles
- Books, knowledge - uncontrolled acquisition, at least at a pace much faster than I can read--library books sit on the shelf while I get more, downloaded books sit in my library while I download more, I seek out more books when I'm feeling a pull/push.

I think I can deal with the tangibles. I already think that areas where I am still acquiring are those where I haven't done as thorough a job of paring down as I needed for myself.

But the harder things are the intangibles--and I think this is a more high-level problem, especially that which brings me to feel that that sense of anxious neediness of acquisition is the norm that I have to fight against:

Intangibles:
- The desire to fix myself, improve myself: tons of personal projects sitting around in Evernote (even though they're in the deferred pile) because I have this obsessive anxious need to see my behavior, both internal and external, through the lens of better or worse as compared to an ambiguous external goal-post. I don't know what to do with this except to try to apply the same mentality as to the tangibles: let go until it feels like it's loosened up. I can try to turn it onto itself in that way and see if I can get somewhere. At the very least I know why I try to better myself: so I can feel less bad feelings, and more good ones, more often. That's an understandable and a self-huggable goal, but I think the pursuit of it has been in me so long--and believing that it's recent has also been in me so long--that it is in part contributing to that. At the very least I think without this driving need to better myself I can actually stop judging myself for bad feelings, which make them into wounds, and start being gentle and accepting. I think even the "I'm just introspecting because I'm trying to understand myself" is a thin veneer for actually wanting to uncover 'problematic' spaces that I judge to need alteration.
  How will I know I have released this anxious fixing?  . . .When I think about things that I have trouble with without ever disbelieving that I am enough.

- Happiness - that works off the first item. Wanting to constantly maximize good feelings. Action - will let go of things without considering if my happiness levels will suffer, staying comforted in the memory of the joyful presence and good work I did in places where I owned very little--an example is as recent as the Woodstock trip day where Rita and I stayed in and I worked all afternoon/night.
- Responsibilities - I keep putting more things on my plate, more to-dos. Such as deciding last week that I would cook all/most of the ingredient items I buy at the time I bring them home . . . that didn't pan out.
