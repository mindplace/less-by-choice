Books have been really hard for me to downsize. On one hand, access to information is very important to me. But books aren't necessarily how I meet that need. When I need to know something, I'll look it up online. Or if it's an extensive topic, I often find an appropriate text at my library.

Instead, my books are really experiences in physical form. The ones I held on to are those that made me feel a certain way, go to some internal place that I wanted to be able to go to on a whim.

How can I say no to that?

<h2 class="header small-header">having access to books</h2>

Over the years, due to travels and moves, I've let go of some books that didn't mean much to me. Some got lost, some were those I knew I didn't want to reread, some were lent out and never gotten back.

But it's been hard to let go of books deliberately when I decided to minimize. There was a time a few years ago when I had thousands of e-books on my computer, but I still felt extremely vulnerable where my books were concerned, afraid to lose them, to lose the experiences they represented to me.

It wasn't about how many I had. It was about filling a hole that could never be filled. I realized that when my mind turned to reading, I often spent more time thinking about the books I potentially wanted to read, and browsing Amazon and Goodreads, instead of actually reading.

I want to be ok with not owning, not having certainty if I get that by owning things. But I want to feel like I have access even if the books I want in the moment aren't immediately available. I am struggling with the feeling that at some point I'll want or need a book and won't have it.

<h2 class="header small-header">Redefining access</h2>

It's true, there's a great chance that that will happen. But I don't think it's really the point to never have unmet desires. Access to me has always been about being able to get an item whenever I want, and to hold on to it for however long I want. But I don't want to own things only because they make me feel less afraid for the future.

If I'm going to not let that rule my life, I have to trust my future self to get what I need, when I need it.

It's not always going to work. But it doesn't always work now, and when that actually happens--when I don't have something I need or want--I'm almost always okay.

I can only do what I can with what I have, today. I can't foresee the future and I shouldn't attempt to preempt my needs, because my perceptions of what I will want or need have demonstrably not been true. For example I had been wrong to think I would definitely read any of the dozens of books that were left unread, years after the purchase date. And it was exhausting to cart them from country to country and try to find storage when I couldn't.

<h2 class="header small-header">after the purge</h2>

Right now I own 13 physical books. I also have about 300 digital books, down from 10k+ that I used to have. These days I delete books that I finish reading or those that I don't end up liking when I start them.

These collections are temporary. At some point I'll have finished reading some, I'll be tired of the others, or I'll discover that I no longer want or need the rest, and let them go.

Tomorrow I'll be able to do a little more than I can do today, if I lighten my tomorrow's load. I know that because I can do a little more today than I could do yesterday, because yesterday I removed some things that were otherwise going to need my attention today. I trust that my future self will only be more capable and more resourceful.

My job is not to give the me of tomorrow everything she might need. My job is to take away from tomorrow's plate everything unnecessary, so that every day I wake up to an easier life where I have the clarity, time, space, and money to make better choices.
