When I was reviewing my things for purging, I realized that I had held on to some things because I wanted to continue to identify as a person who used or needed those things. For example, I held on to great academic texts because I wanted to identify as an academic.

But I wasn't using those things. It was a way of lying to myself about who I am today. Using these things, I was telling myself a story about who I had once wanted to be . . . even though I don't want that anymore.

<h2 class="header small-header">letting go of my identity as a student</h2>

Logically, I know I will never be a freshman in college for the first time again. I won't ever again study literature. I haven't touched a single article from my school days since I left school, and not because I hadn't had the opportunity. I had plenty of opportunity, but I consistently chose not to, because deep down I already felt it to not be important. Those days are over.

One day I might be a student again working on a degree. But it won't be a literature degree.

So I deleted almost all my academic files. They've always sat at the top of my database folder, stately and pompous, giving a kind of structure and meaningfulness to the bits below. But that was artificial. My schooling stopped giving my life structure after I graduated, and I never really accepted that.

I did not delete my memories or my successes by deleting my archives. I just accept that that part of my life is over and new chapters have elapsed since then. I need to clear that stuff away so I can give my focus to the present.

I let go of all my academic books. I realized I kept them because I wanted to stay identified as someone who has a couple of English degrees, and all that that entailed, including being an 'intellectual'.

I wanted to put my universities, like a fur mantle, over my shoulders and over my head, to ensconce me in intelligence and knowledge. But my hands are empty of that mantle. It was a room, a place, something that happened once. I'm not that person anymore. We've grown apart, we don't live in the same places anymore.

<h2 class="header small-header">letting go of my identity as an artist</h2>

One thing that I've done a lot of in my life is pursue artistic outlets. I created and sold ceramic pottery and sculptures, drew with various mediums, painted with oils and watercolors, created miniatures and dioramas, knitted, made miniature gardens, made general crafts and gifts, and plenty of other things.

I had a lot of art supplies left over from these hobbies, but I hadn't actually done those things in a long time. I just didn't feel the need, and if I was honest with myself, I've felt the need quite rarely over the past several years.

I knew at some point in the future I might feel the need again. But for every other day that I have to live with extra stuff, it's not worth holding on to it, especially when art supplies are fairly easily accessible. So, I donated everything except a small sketchbook and some pencils.

I'm working now on letting go of completed art projects I've done that no longer make me happy but which feel important and special.

<h2 class="header small-header">letting go but retaining what mattered</h2>

I love that I had the chance in my life to study what I did, to do all those different things. But they don't define me today, and I don't want to hold on to them because of unfinished business. I will keep the learnings that apply to my life moving forward, but allow the content to slip away.
