Minimalise to allow the essential to thrive.
Take a moment to understand.
Accept what you love.
Don't get lost in comfort.
You are here.
Ambivalence is also ok.
Reach.
Be honest.
Just start.
Don't look away.
Follow through that thought.
Let fear grow and guide you.
Let the process flow.
Connect to the larger picture.
Reach out and touch.
Decide, do, and follow through.
You don't have to strive for a life where every desire is met.
