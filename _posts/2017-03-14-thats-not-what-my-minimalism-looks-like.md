## Do these kinds of images look familiar?

## These images don't appeal to me.

They imply a kind of coldness to me. If my home or world looked like that, I would feel as though I'm sacrificing the best of me towards a kind of aesthetic.

It reminds me of articles that suggest that minimalism is about buying 1 gadget to replace 5. No, thank you: my minimalism is of the **no purchase necessary** variety.

## This is more like it.

Each time I let go of my unused, unnecessary, or no-longer-appropriate items, my life becomes lighter.

I'm letting go to make room for adventure, freedom, experience, and a very different set of challenges than what I've been faced with. I want to spend time in nature, see new places, learn new things. I don't want to own less things because that aesthetic looks good to me, I own less because living with less makes living out my real values possible.

No thank you to the coldness and whiteness of emptiness. Instead, I'm working towards the warmth of sunlight on your face when you wake up from a nap in a green place.
