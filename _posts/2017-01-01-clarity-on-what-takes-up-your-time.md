All these areas that have my energy and I don't feel like I'm making strides anywhere. There's real and figurative clutter everywhere, from my mind to my external sphere. I feel guilty for how scattered I am and how little energy I can give to any one thing. I feel guilty at the thought of dropping any of these projects/processes/focuses because it leaves unfulfilled a commitment I made to myself in the past, destroying my sense of personal responsibility and continuity.
Here's what I know about myself:
I am not a naturally high-energy person. I don't have enough to go around if I go in all directions, goaded first by a need to get joy to counteract suffering, and then by guilt for being paralyzed and not doing the hard work needed to filfill the obligation I've placed upon myself. I can often react to this by looking away from the problems I have created to new bright potentials in the world, which inevitably turn into new directions and projects for me to lose energy and perpetuate the cycle.
My solution is obvious:
1. Stop adding new commitments.
2. Close out the projects that can be closed out.
3. Being brutally honest, range my projects by enjoyment and life-importance.
4. Cut away projects, leaving a handful to focus on, decommitting to all the others.

I can feel every part of myself trying to turn away from the oncoming onslaught of guilt and sadness. Oh, I'm going to do my best, but...
