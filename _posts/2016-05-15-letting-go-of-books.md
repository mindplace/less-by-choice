I'm thinking of that moment from Inside Out when Joy tells Sadness that Riley needs her and only her, and eventually gives her all the core memories to hold and turn sad. It feels like the appropriate thing to think of now that I've found myself facing something that it's time to say goodbye to.

Logically, I know I will never be a freshman in college for the first time again. I won't ever be that. I won't ever again study literature...that much I am certain of. I haven't touched a single article from my school days since I left school...and not because I hadn't had the opportunity. I had plenty of opportunity, but I consistently chose not to, because deep down I implcitly knew it isn't important to me anymore. Those days are over. This is my memory and my processing.

I was so happy as a student. It wasn't just happiness that I felt of course, in fact on the surface I was usually feeling pretty not-ok. But in SBU and in QMUL, the background was a feeling of gratitude and joy and wonder. I was learning so much. I was reaching out into so many repositories of knowledge and wisdom, and in my joy was ready to give them any amount of meaningfulness. I loved being a student. It was the best time in my life. One day I might be a student again working on a degree...but it won't be a literature degree.

When I finish this blog post, I will be deleting my academic file archives... they've always sat at the top of my database folder, stately and pompous, giving a kind of structure and meaningfulness to the bits below. But that was illusory. My schooling stopped giving my life structure after I graduated, and I never really accepted that.

I accept it now. I alone give my life structure. I create meaning, combining meaningful things into beauty to feel the enjoyment of living. I am not deleting my memories or my successes by deleting my archives; I am simply accepting that that part of my life is over and new chapters have elapsed since then. I am still working on some papers, but now I work directly with the essays I've written so I can send them for publication.

I wanted to put my universities, like a fur mantle, over my shoulders and over my head, to ensconce me in intelligence and knowledge...but my hands are empty of that mantle. It was a room, a place, a once-love. We've grown apart, we don't live in the same places anymore.

I love you, my academic past. I love who I became because I studied. I will keep the learnings but allow the content to slip away.
