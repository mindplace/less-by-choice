I underwent a major process of clearing out and letting go a few months ago.

As I went through my things, I started to realize more and more the extent to which physical items can detract from my energy and the things I am currently doing by being symbols of failure, things left undone, or simply having outlived their purpose in my life. My clearing-out has forced me to confront what I truly love, and the kind of lifestyle I want to lead at home. It also made me realize what I actually want: to travel and to live lightly.

I've sold nearly my entire library, downsized to 1 drawer of clothes, cleared out the kitchen, given away way more knick-knacks than I can even think of.

In the process I have had to confront the pain of failing things I had wanted to do. Things like not doing projects in a timely way, or at all, had stayed with me for years, in the form of my stuff. In deciding to let go, I got the closure that I had been trying to get by keeping those items around with the burdening intention of doing that project in the future. I had to accept that I had failed and to move on, instead of holding on to the stuff and thinking that one day I would get to it.

I've confronted and worked through a lot of inner strife this way and although I still have a ways to go, I can already really feel the lightness of being that comes of unburdening oneself of the things that had come to me in joyfulness but turned into duty.

I cleared out the majority of things I said 'yes' to without consideration of my circumstances, both those things that I intended for the present and the future. I feel how so many of my mixed-up feelings about things are clearing away and becoming more themselves, turning more clearly into sadness, or regret, or gladness, or adoration.

I really like how ambiguity started turning into clarity while losing its emotional baggage. I think I'm better for it.
