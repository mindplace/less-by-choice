I want for everything I own to have purpose, and to be used for that purpose. Want life at home to potentiate inspiration-driven work and action-producing learning.

I want to feel relaxed and alert. I want to wake up to cleanliness, visual sparseness and harmony. I'd like it to be a conducive space to work, reflect, play, and relax.
