takeaway: ["Is a capsule wardrobe a good idea for you?", "What boundaries would you set on your capsule wardrobe?"]
---

A few months ago, I read several [capsule wardrobe posts](http://www.xojane.com/clothes/project-33-capsule-wardrobe), including the original [Project 333](http://bemorewithless.com/project-333/) post, and decided to try putting together my own capsule. It was appealing to me to temporarily place boundaries on what I would wear, as if I was on a trip. I wanted to see if it would help with determining what clothes I could let go of.

By this time, I had already gone through an iteration of the [KonMari method](http://tidyingup.com/) but I felt like I didn't do it properly. When I was growing up, my family was very poor, and the idea of getting rid of useful items was extremely hard to bear, and I often chose to keep things because of the shame and guilt I felt when imagining donating it. All in all, however, I donated over 5 large bags of clothes when using her method.

Still, I had so much! Much more than I needed: an entire closet's worth, plus a 6 drawer dresser, plus some stored off-season clothes, plus costume supplies. I needed a way to just try out a smaller lifestyle without permanently getting rid of anything right away.

<h2 class="small-header header">First iteration</h2>

The first step was to go through my entire closet. I took everything I owned and put it on the bed and the floor, then looked at every single item, making difficult decisions. Often I held an item in my hand and found myself up against a long inner litany of considerations. I fretted about needing items, not knowing what to prepare for, and worried about having too little. It bothered me that I had a lot of clothes that weren't going to make it into the capsule, as though I was telling those good clothes that they were worthless.

One mistake I made was to lump in together my considerations for clothes that had different purposes. As soon as I was done with the sorting, I realized that I had set aside "work clothes" that I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing out for fun, because I would worry that I would get them dirty or wrinkled or etc. I also discovered that if I only looked at the work clothes I setup for myself, I realized that I was 110% in shape with that: as promised, every piece left were those that I really loved; tops and bottoms matched effortlessly; and there were only enough pieces to get me through 2 weeks' worth of wear.

In the end, I stuck with it, and put almost everything into suitcases. I kept about 50 items for my capsule, counting shirts, pants, skirts, tights, shoes, and sweaters. I didn't count or limit my socks or underwear. I cleared out so much that I was able to move my chest of drawers into my closet, and still had space left over! I was very proud of myself.

<h2 class="header small-header">Second iteration</h2>

But I still had one big issue. Once I was done with sorting, my main reasons for doing this went away immediately, the issue of being overwhelmed with having stuff. Now I know what I have when I reach in. But still, what I had didn't fit right, doesn't show me off as beautiful, makes me feel uncomfortable or constricted, etc. I was worried that I was being too harsh with cutting off stuff; but in reality there was only one item I missed that I had thrown out (purple bathing bra), and only two items I missed that I had put away (miniskirt and cardigan). I still wasn't wearing all the items I had, and I still wasn't feeling like I enjoyed what I owned. It also didn't take away completely my impulse to go shopping for the things I am missing, although when I do shop now, I find it much easier to do so because I'm considering all the items I do actually have.

I worry that if I go back and do it properly again, cutting just as hard, I will be left with nothing to wear at all. I know I'll be cutting down to just about nothing. That's not a comfortable thought.

Well, I just have to remind myself that at this point I am not throwing anything out, just cutting back by putting it away. It's not gone, just less accessible. Hope that will help get me into this capsule wardrobe successfulness. With work clothes, as soon as I finished, I deeply felt it, and it was very freeing and fresh and exciting, and it made me excited to put on all those clothes and go doing stuff in them. I want to reach that same subliminal completeness as that. Wishing myself luck.

<h2 class="header small-header">Third iteration</h2>

A few months after, I actually donated nearly all of the clothes I had set aside, so much so that I ended up getting rid of my chest of drawers entirely and even clearing out the rest of the clothes in my closet. Now, all my clothes live in a single drawer of my boyfriend's Ikea Pax wardrobe.
