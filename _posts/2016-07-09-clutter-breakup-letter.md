When I think of stuff I don't need in my life anymore, most often I'm thinking actually of the things I do love, because I use it so often. Things like my computer, my bookbag and small bag, my wallet and phone. These are my daily tools, and I love using them. Other things come to mind too--my kitchen tools, my toothpaste, my goat milk soap. My window gardens and treasures. The awesome grey blanket on the couch. Ash's crate setup. My box of nail supplies.

It's everything else I want to clear away. Clothes that don't make me happy to wear them, bottles and things that aren't serving me, shoes I haven't chosen to wear this year, odds and ends that aren't serving a purpose.

I got a lot of those things because I was enticed by the kind of aesthetic they came with. Those leather shoes made me think of upright lawyers with secret smiles, being able to fit into a corporate world and yet not be out of place at a bohemian coffeehouse. Elegant and chic. Even a little Victorian.

But I didn't wear them. Because I'm not actually interested in what it means to be a lawyer or a bohemian coffeehouse goer. That's not the life I choose for myself every day. I carried them around from country to country, hoping that they would carry me into those secret worlds without any effort, but making no real strides towards them. I indulged in dreaming, and carried them with me to be the physical embodiment of that dream, but did not work to turn that into reality.

And I never sat down to think about it. The truth is, it's a waste of time, energy, and yearning. From hope, they became a burden--a terrible thing for hope to turn into.

I haven't touched those shoes in probably two years, if not more. I have a lot of things like that--clothes, games, even some books left, odds and ends too, that I have carried around without being available to the dreams they came with for me.

When I say goodbye to you, my things, I am really saying goodbye to the dreams you represent. I thought dreams are weightless, but desire is not. It costs me my attention, my pleasure, my time. Allowing myself to indulge in dreams without giving myself the greater opportunity to pursue them wholeheartedly is a kind of internal torture, and the battleground are you, my things. I am already pursuing several important things--being a developer, a girlfriend, a mom to my dog, a caretaker of my home, a spiritual being of no-form and here-now--and these pursuits are worth the greatest part of my attention, focus, and effort.

I'm giving you up now because I'm uncovering something important to me: inner peace, outer beauty, and abundance. I'm saying goodbye so I can embrace my truer style. I'm trading you away for more clarity and focus, and to downsize a sense of being burdened. I need you to go because I don't want to feel guilty anymore for not living the dream or lifestyle you represent to me. I'm giving you up to pursue my work as a web- and self- developer.

Goodbye, and thank you.  I know I will miss some of you, because of the dreams I give up as I give you up, but I will let myself indulge in the nostalgia and gentle regret, and learn from that too.

love,
me
