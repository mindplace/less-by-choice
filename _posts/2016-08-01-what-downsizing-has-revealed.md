That my management style for needs and desires is to patiently wait them out, argue with them, resist them, or passively accept them in a way that doesn't bring action, until they subside. It feels safer to not have needs or desires, because the world gives less than it demands in pursuit of things I may need or desire. I feel pride knowing I can get by on less. I am not sure if I actually feel that these perspectives are healthy.

That I really have a limited attention span for things and the fewer I have, the more relaxed and attentive I can be to each of them. This is more along the essentialist-style mindset and I feel myself resonating nicely with it. It makes sense to think that as soon as I cut things away, those that are left get a better portion of my attention and energy.

That it is really hard to let go, but once I've crossed that hump, looking back on having a relationship with an item feels much easier, and I feel much less regret and loss than I did right before I actually let go. Like breaking up, it feels much worse right before I've done it, becoming more difficult to let go the closer I get to letting go, and then as soon as I've made the decision to move on, that's all over and I can look back much more honestly on what it was like to have the thing.

My ideal lifestyle. It never occurred to me to ask myself what kind of actions I want my home to help me with. When I started discarding, I realized that the end result would mean that I would be surrounded only by the things I love and use just about every day, and that that would mean that my life would be reshaped slightly into a lifestyle where I do things that bring me pleasure every day. So I had to imagine what it would look like if I was building it from scratch instead of revealing it.

That I implicitly value my mental life over my physical life, but the circumstances of my physical life must propel me in the right way into different aspects of my mental life. In order to do good work, I must have a clean and minimal space so I am not distracted visually or by things undone; in order to reflect or read or meditate, I must have access to the appropriate media in a comfortable setting; in order to support my emotional state so I can do anything, I must be surrounded by green and sunlight.

That I CAN say 'no' to things that might come into my attention, things other people might ask me to do, or things that occur to me. David Allen was right: your conscience won't really let you say no to things based on how much attention you may have for them (as opposed to whether you do or don't want to do them) when you don't know how much you actually have to do. Which conversely to me is that you can say no to things when you do know how much you actually have.

That I have escapist tendencies. I have often chosen not to look--not to fully grasp something, not to understand something--in order to not have to deal with it. Confronting my things--relics of such experiences--helped me process a great deal of things this way and be more deliberate in choosing clarity.

My styles. My style of clothing; my style of working; my style of housecleaning; my style of consuming media.
